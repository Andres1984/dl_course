## First Task in TensorFlow

a) Open the notebook [XXX](XXX) and visualize the computational graph in TensorBoard

Hint: run all cells in the notebook and then open a terminal and type: tensorboard --logdir=path/to/log-directory

b) Change the code in the notebook that it divides the matrix multiplication by 10 instead of multiplying it with 10. Compare the numpy and tensorflow restults. What do you observe?
```
  import tensorflow as tf
```
