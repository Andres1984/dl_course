## Simple RNN on artificial data 

Open the notebook [14_simple_rnn_tf1_no_solution.ipynb](https://github.com/tensorchiefs/dl_course/blob/master/notebooks/14_simple_rnn_tf1_no_solution.ipynb).

a) Forward pass with trained weights ($W$ and $b$): Complete the code for the single time step forward pass from the hidden state $h_0 \rightarrow h_1$. 

b) Complete the forward pass for a sequence of time steps. 

c) Use ($V$ and $bv$) to calculate the output probabilities for time step 1. Hint: You might want to use a softmax.

d) Try to understand the training code (Keras and/or TensorFlow). 

e) Do the training with a hidden state of size of 4 and change it then to 2, how is the performance affected? Use the TensorFlow code, which currently runs much faster.
