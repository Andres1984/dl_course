## Using a Variational autoencoder to generate digit examples

Open the notebook [18_VAE.ipynb](https://github.com/tensorchiefs/dl_course/blob/master/notebooks/18_VAE_solution.ipynb).

a) Where do we define a reward for a good reconstruction?

b) Complete the fowardpass of the encoder in cell 12. Use the Model() function. What are the inputs and what are the outputs?

c) Now do the fowardpass for the test data in cell 13 and plot the 2D latent space in a scatterplot, use different colors for the corresponding digit label.
What do you lean from this plot?

d) In the last cell we gernerate samples from the learned latent space distribution, can you find something like a "new" digit?
